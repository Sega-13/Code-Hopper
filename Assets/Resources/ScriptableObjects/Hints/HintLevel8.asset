  puzzles:
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-1
    hintSteps:
    - "Move the delegate declaration outside of the Main method \u2014 it should
      be at the class level."
    - Assign a method to greetUser before invoking it.
    - Define a method that matches the delegate signature (i.e., a method that returns
      void and takes no parameters).
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-2
    hintSteps:
    - "Move the delegate definition and DoSomething method outside of Main \u2014
      make them members of the class."
    - "Remove all public modifiers from inside Main; they\u2019re only valid in the
      class scope."
    - ' Assign the method DoSomething to the delegate onAction, and then call it.'
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-3
    hintSteps:
    - ' Do not overwrite the delegate if you want to keep all the subscribed methods.'
    - "If your goal is to invoke both LogToFile and LogToConsole, just use += to
      add them and don\u2019t reassign."
    - "Use log?.Invoke() instead of log() for safer invocation in real-world code
      \u2014 it checks for null before calling."
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-4
    hintSteps:
    - "Make sure the delegate signature matches the method \u2014 Add takes two int
      parameters, but the delegate MathOp takes none."
    - Either update the delegate to accept two int parameters, or modify Add() to
      take none (and return a constant, for example).
    - "Check the delegate signature first when assigning any method \u2014 both parameters
      and return types must match exactly."
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-5
    hintSteps:
    - "Check the delegate signature \u2014 it returns string, so the method assigned
      to it must return string too."
    - 'Match the method return type to the delegate: the method must be string ConcatStrings(...),
      not int.'
    - Your return statement is fine, it just needs the return type to match (string).
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-6
    hintSteps:
    - " Remove or correct the misleading comment \u2014 the delegate is correctly
      invoking both NotifyUser and NotifyAdmin."
    - "Understand how multicast delegates work \u2014 using += adds multiple methods,
      and they are all invoked in order."
    - "Ensure no exceptions in any method \u2014 if one method in the delegate list
      throws an exception, later ones won\u2019t run.\n\n"
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-7
    hintSteps:
    - 'Use an expression-bodied lambda: For single expressions, you can drop the
      braces and just return the result directly.'
    - If using braces, you must include a return statement and a semicolon.
    - 'Match the delegate return type: The delegate returns an int, so your lambda
      must return an int.'
  - puzzleId: Level-8-puzzle-8
    hintSteps:
    - "Match the parameter type: Ensure the delegate and the method both use the
      same type \u2014 either both use int or both use string."
    - 'Match the argument: The argument passed to the delegate must match its expected
      parameter type.'
    - 'Don''t change only one thing: Either change both the delegate and method to
      use string, or change the passed argument to an int.
