    hintSteps:
    - "The constructor has a parameter named type, but there\u2019s also a field
      named type. Are you assigning the value to the correct one?"
    - ' In type = type;, both sides refer to the parameter. How can you refer to
      the instance variable instead?'
    - Use the this keyword when you want to refer to the current object's field,
      like this.type = type;.
  - puzzleId: Level-7-puzzle-2
    hintSteps:
    - you're trying to assign a Vehicle object to a Car variable. Is that allowed
      in inheritance?
    - ' The StartEngine method is marked private in Vehicle. Can Car access it directly?'
    - 'To allow derived classes like Car to use StartEngine, consider changing its
      access modifier. Is private the right choice here?

  - puzzleId: Level-7-puzzle-3
    hintSteps:
    - "The method Multiply(int a, double b) exists\u2014but you\u2019re calling it
      with 2.0 (a double) and 3 (an int). Does that match exactly?"
    - C# method overload resolution is sensitive to argument order and types. If
      you pass double, int, will it match either method exactly?
    - Try reversing the parameter types in the method or cast the arguments to ensure
      a perfect match. Otherwise, the compiler may get confused or throw an error.
  - puzzleId: Level-7-puzzle-4
    hintSteps:
    - "You're calling a static method (AddPoints)\u2014but it's trying to access
      a score variable. Is score also static?"
    - In C#, static methods can only access other static members. Does score meet
      that requirement?
    - Decide whether score should track points globally (make it static) or per-instance
      (change how AddPoints is called).
  - puzzleId: Level-7-puzzle-5
    hintSteps:
    - "The line Day {} is incomplete. What kind of type are you trying to define
      here\u2014class, struct, or enum?"
    - You're using Day.Monday. Does Day need to be an enum to support that kind of
      syntax?
    - Make sure you define Day as an enum with named values like Monday, Tuesday,
      etc., so the assignment works correctly.
  - puzzleId: Level-7-puzzle-6
    hintSteps:
    - You're trying to assign an int to a variable of type Difficulty. Are they the
      same type, even if the values match?
    - An explicit cast is needed when converting from an int to an enum. C# doesn't
      allow implicit conversion here.
    - Use syntax like (Difficulty)level to tell the compiler you know what you're
      doing and want to convert the number into an enum value.
  - puzzleId: Level-7-puzzle-7
    hintSteps:
    - "You\u2019re using a Queue<string> and calling Dequeue() multiple times. How
      many items are actually in the queue before the first Dequeue()?"
    - Dequeue() removes and returns the first item. What happens if you try to dequeue
      more items than the queue contains?
    - To avoid exceptions, check if the queue is empty using Count or Any() before
      calling Dequeue().
